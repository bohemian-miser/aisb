"""
Run every section's reference solution end-to-end and report what breaks.

This is a *verification* tool for content owners, not part of the participant
build. `build_instructions.py` turns a `*_solution.py` into the participant
handout; this script turns the same file into the filled-in answer -- every
`if "SOLUTION":` branch taken, every `test_*` call left in place -- executes it,
and tells you which sections fail.

Workflow for one section, e.g. 1.2-logprobs/section2_solution.py:

    1. Generate 1.2-logprobs/section2_answers.py containing the correct code.
    2. Run it with the section folder as the working directory, so its
       `from section2_test import test_...` imports resolve.
    3. Delete the answers file immediately, pass or fail.

Step 3 is the default and should stay that way on any machine participants can
reach: the answers file contains every solution for the section. It is written,
executed, and removed inside a try/finally, a stale-file sweep at startup cleans
up after a hard kill, and `*_answers.py` is gitignored so an interrupted run can
never be committed.

Pass --remain to keep the generated files instead, so a failing section can be
edited and re-run by hand. They are still swept away at the start of the next
run, and still gitignored -- but on a shared pod they are readable answers
sitting in the repo until then.

Usage:
    python aisb_utils/test_solutions.py --day 3        # every 3.x section
    python aisb_utils/test_solutions.py --day 1 --day 2
    python aisb_utils/test_solutions.py --all          # every section
    python aisb_utils/test_solutions.py --all --list   # dry run, list only
    python aisb_utils/test_solutions.py --day 1 --remain   # keep them to debug
    python aisb_utils/test_solutions.py --day 3 --skip 3.3.5   # all but that exercise
    python aisb_utils/test_solutions.py --day 3 --skip 3.4     # all but that section

Every run starts with a CUDA preflight, and a day that needs a GPU stops there
if there is not a usable one (--no-gpu-check overrides).

Exit status is 0 only if every section ran to completion with exit code 0.
