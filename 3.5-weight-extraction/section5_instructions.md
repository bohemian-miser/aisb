### Exercise 3.5.1: Find the hidden dimension of a toy black box

> **Difficulty**: 1/5
> **Importance**: 3/5
>
> You should spend up to ~10 minutes on this exercise.

In this exercise, we're going to use SVD to find how much information is
really in a matrix, even when it's spread over far more rows and columns than
it needs.

Starting with a matrix `A` of shape `(1000, d)` and multiplying it by `B`
`(d, 1000)` produces `C` `(1000, 1000)`, which hides the intermediate
dimension `d`. If `d < 1000` then there are only `d` dimensions of
information embedded in `C`. These can be extracted using SVD, since there can
only be `d` singular directions in `C`.

`np.linalg.svd` returns the singular values, largest first. The first `d` are
real. The rest are zero, or float noise around 1e-13. Count the real ones and
you have `d`.

`blackbox` does the multiply with a `d` you can't see. Query it, run SVD, read
off `d`.


```python


def blackbox(d: int, size: int = 1000) -> np.ndarray:
    """Return the (size, size) product of random (size, d) and (d, size) matrices."""
    A = np.random.randn(size, d)
    B = np.random.randn(d, size)
    return A @ B


def estimate_rank(C: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int, np.ndarray]:
    """Return (rank, singular_values) of C.

    Singular values below 1e-10 times the largest are float noise and don't count.
    """
    # TODO
    # Hint: np.linalg.svd(C, compute_uv=False) returns the singular values,
    # largest first.
    return 0, np.zeros(1)


hidden_d = np.random.randint(5, 21)
C = blackbox(hidden_d)
rank, s = estimate_rank(C)
print(f"estimated rank: {rank}")
print(f"hidden d:       {hidden_d}")

# The cliff should sit on the dotted line.
plt.semilogy(s[:40], "o-")
plt.axvline(hidden_d - 0.5, color="red", linestyle=":", label="true d")
plt.xlabel("Singular value index")
plt.ylabel("Singular value (log scale)")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
from section5_test import test_estimate_rank


test_estimate_rank(estimate_rank)
```

A language model's last layer is this multiply: hidden state `(1, d)` times
weights `(d, vocab_size)` gives the logits. The same trick finds `d`.

Let's implement the model extraction attack from
[Carlini et al. (2024), *Stealing Part of a Production Language Model*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06634).

### Exercise 3.5.3: Extracting Model Weights

> **Difficulty**: 5/5
> **Importance**: 2/5
>
> You should spend up to ~60 minutes on this exercise.

Now use the hidden dimension `h` from exercise 3.5.2 to recover the model's output
projection matrix, `lm_head.weight`, from black-box logit queries alone.

**Why SVD gives us the weights.** Every logit vector the model returns is computed as:

```
logits = hidden_state @ W_out.T + bias
```

where `W_out` has shape `(vocab_size, h)`. Across many queries, the hidden states
span an `h`-dimensional subspace of the full `vocab_size`-dimensional space. If we
collect these logit vectors as columns of a matrix `Q` (shape `vocab_size × n_queries`),
then `Q` has rank at most `h`. The thin SVD decomposes:

```
Q ≈ U_h · Σ_h · Vh
```

where `U_h` has shape `(vocab_size, h)`. The columns of `U_h` form an orthonormal
basis for the same column space as `W_out`. Therefore `U_h @ Σ_h` is `W_out` up
to an unknown invertible linear transformation: we can reconstruct the direction
and relative scaling of every output-projection row, but not the exact values
(which would require knowing the hidden states too).

This is the "up to a linear transform" claim: the extracted matrix and the true
`lm_head.weight` are related by `W_extracted @ G ≈ W_true` for some matrix `G`.
`compare_weights` solves for `G` via least squares and then measures how close
the aligned matrices are.


```python

### Extensions to try
- What if you only have access to topk logits instead of the full logits?
- What if you don't have access to the logits? (this is quiet expensive, so just extract one logit with the method listed in appendix F)


## Summary & Further Reading

Today covered four layers of LLM inference security:

**1. Tokenization & prompt construction**: tokenizers are not transparent:
different models tokenize the same string differently, and chat templates
assemble multi-turn prompts with special tokens. Edge cases in tokenization
and prompt construction are where many prompt-injection attacks begin.

**2. Guardrails: attacks and defences**: safety training alone is defeated
by simple paraphrases. Keyword filters are defeated by synonyms. LLM-based
input classifiers are defeated by creative reframing (fiction, research).
Output classifiers share the same limitation. Linear probes on internal
representations catch what text-based classifiers miss, because they operate
on semantic intent rather than surface form.

**3. Knowledge distillation attacks**: label filtering (masking forbidden
tokens with `ignore_index=-100`) prevents a baseline student from learning
the forbidden completion. But adding a KD loss (temperature-scaled KL
divergence from the teacher) transfers the forbidden knowledge through the
soft probability distribution. Label filtering is necessary but not
sufficient for safe distillation.

**4. Model weight extraction via SVD**: by collecting logits from random
prompts and computing SVD, an attacker can recover the model's hidden
dimension from the singular value spectrum, and reconstruct the output
projection layer up to a linear transformation.
