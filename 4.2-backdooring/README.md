# 4.2 — Fine-tuning data poisoning and backdoors

## What to expect

Participants construct a poisoned training set, fine-tune a small chat model,
and evaluate whether a trigger creates targeted behavior without destroying
clean performance.

**Suggested time:** 120 minutes

**Exercises:** [Open the participant instructions](section2_instructions.md)

| Area | Prerequisites coming in | Main learnings going out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engineering | - | Transform and inspect a dataset, configure fine-tuning, cache artifacts, and reproduce an evaluation |
| ML | Supervised fine-tuning, train/validation splits, and classification accuracy | Explain poison rate, trigger/target supervision, assistant-token loss, and clean-versus-triggered metrics |
| Security | Data poisoning, backdoors, and training-data access | Define attacker access, implant a trigger, test specificity and variants, and propose detection/mitigation controls |
| Theory | - | Determine what evidence supports the claim that relatively few poisoned examples can control behavior |

### Background

- Required prework: the [PyTorch Blitz](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/index.html) and Hugging Face [chat templates](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/chat_templating).
- Read the abstract and introduction of [*Poisoning Language Models During Instruction Tuning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00944); the full paper is optional longer reading.
- References: Hugging Face Datasets [transformations](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/process) and the Transformers [fine-tuning guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training).
