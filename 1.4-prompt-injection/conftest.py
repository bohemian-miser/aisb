"""Pytest path setup for this section's generated test file.

The extracted ``section4_test.py`` imports the ``rag_server`` module (the
support bot participants attack), which lives alongside this section. pytest
loads this conftest before collecting the test module, so inserting the paths
here makes that import resolve. Uses the same root-discovery snippet as the
solution.
