# 1.4 — Prompt injection and RAG poisoning

## What to expect

Participants threat-model an LLM application, probe a defended RAG system, and
craft an indirect injection against the boundary between instructions and data.

The target ships as `rag_server.py` and is not edited. Participants attack it
through its public API (`ask`, `add_document`) from their own answer file, and
reconstruct its system prompt and defenses by probing rather than by reading.

**Suggested time:** 75–90 minutes

**Exercises:** [Open the participant instructions](section4_instructions.md)

| Area | Prerequisites coming in | Main learnings going out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engineering | RAG and MCP architecture | Operate a small RAG application through its public API, poison its knowledge base, and run a controlled attack |
| ML | Context windows and prompt serialization | Explain why retrieved text and trusted instructions share a model context despite application-level delimiters |
| Security | Sources, sinks, trust boundaries, and attacker-controlled input | Enumerate untrusted channels, perform black-box reconnaissance, and distinguish mitigations from complete prevention |
| Theory | - | Explain why prompt injection is partly an architectural control problem rather than only a prompt-writing problem |

### Background
